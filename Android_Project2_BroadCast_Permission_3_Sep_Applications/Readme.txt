Application A1 deﬁnes a new dangerous-level permission called “edu.uic.cs478.project3” and sends one of two kinds of broadcasts. The other two applications will receive the broadcasts; however, these applicationswillreceive thebroadcastsonlyifthesender(i.e., A1)hasthatpermission. Inaddition, A1 deﬁnes an activity containing two read-only text views and two buttons. The buttons, when selected, will broadcast two different intents with actions concerning the professional sports of basketball and baseball, depending on the button pressed. The text views describe the meaning of the buttons to the device user. Both broadcasts are ordered broadcasts. 



 Application A2 just receives the intents sent by A1; A2 does not contain any activities. Whenever an intent is received, A2 displays a toast message on the device’s display. The toast message indicates whether the broadcast sender was selecting basketball or baseball. However, A2’s broadcast receiver is designed in such a way that it will only respond to a broadcast if the broadcast sender has permission “edu.uic.cs478.project3”. 


  Application A3 also receives A1’s broadcasts if the sender has permission “edu.uic.cs478.project3”. Depending on the intent received, A3 will launch one of two activities. The ﬁrst activity displays informationaboutatleast6teamsfromtheNationalBasketballAssociation(NBA).Thesecondactivity showsatleast6teamsfromtheMajorLeagueBaseball(MLB)league. However,bothactivitiesrequire the application user to grant permission “edu.uic.cs478.project3” before displaying the teams. In addition, each activity consists of two fragments, whose behavior is described below. Finally, application A3 maintains an options menu and an action bar. The action bar shows the name of the application (your choice) and the overﬂow area. The options menu allows a device user to switch between basketball and baseball. The options menu should be clearly accessible from the overﬂow area.
